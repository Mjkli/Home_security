# Home security

Trial run project showcasing the ablity to setup arduino ( nano esp32 ) to send a reed switch status.
Ideally used for windows and doors to see if they are closed. Want to create a webserver you an login toto see the status of your devices. 

Want to be able to add new devices in the future using the website.

Then maybe other appliances in the future.
